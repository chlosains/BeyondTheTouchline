# Beyond the Touchline

Welcome to the Beyond the Touchline repository! This repository contains all the code used for football analytics published on my Substack (beyondthetouchline.substack.com). It demonstrates my skills in data analysis, visualisation, and storytelling using football data.

## **Overview**

This repository showcases:
- Scraping and cleaning football data from sources like Wyscout, FBref and StatsBomb.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of player and team performances.
- Creating visualisations such as xG flow charts, pass maps, and radar charts.
- Machine learning models for player and team performance forecasting.

## **Features**

- **Data Collection**: Scripts to scrape data and convert it into usable formats.
- **Data Analysis**: Python scripts for statistical analysis of football performance data.
- **Visualisations**: Examples of visual content, such as heatmaps, pass networks, and radar charts.
- **Substack Articles**: Links to articles where this code has been used.

## **Getting Started**

### **Dependencies**
